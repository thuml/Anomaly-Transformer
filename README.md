Anomaly Transformer: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Association Discrepancy

Unsupervised detection of anomaly points in time series is a challenging problem, which requires the model to learn informative representation and derive a distinguishable criterion. In this paper, we propose the Anomaly Transformer in these three folds:

- An inherent distinguishable criterion as **Association Discrepancy** for detection.
- A new **Anomaly-Attention** mechanism to compute the association discrepancy.
- A **minimax strategy** to amplify the normal-abnormal distinguishability of the association discrepancy.

## Get Started

1. Install Python 3.6, PyTorch >= 1.4.0. 
(Thanks Élise for the contribution in solving the environment. See this [issue](https://github.com/thuml/Anomaly-Transformer/issues/11) for details.)
2. Download data. You can obtain four benchmarks from [Google Cloud](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gisthCoE-RrKJ0j3KPV7xiibhHWT9qRm?usp=sharing). **All the datasets are well pre-processed**. For the SWaT dataset, you can apply for it by following its official tutorial.
3. Train and evaluate. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts`. You can reproduce the experiment results as follows:
```bash
bash ./scripts/SMD.sh
bash ./scripts/MSL.sh
bash ./scripts/SMAP.sh
bash ./scripts/PSM.sh
```

Especially, we use the adjustment operation proposed by [Xu et al, 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03903.pdf) for model evaluation. If you have questions about this, please see this [issue](https://github.com/thuml/Anomaly-Transformer/issues/14) or email us.

## Main Result

We compare our model with 15 baselines, including THOC, InterFusion, etc. **Generally,  Anomaly-Transformer achieves SOTA.**
